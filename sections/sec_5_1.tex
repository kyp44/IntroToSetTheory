  Prove properties (a)-(n) of cardinal arithmetic stated in the text of this section.
  These are

  (a) $\k + \l = \l + \k$

  (b) $\k + (\l + \mu) = (\k + \l) + \mu$

  (c) $\k \leq \k + \l$

  (d) If $\k_1 \leq \k_2$ and $\l_1 \leq \l_2$, then $\k_1 + \l_1 \leq \k_2 + \l_2$

\sol{
For solutions (a) through (c) suppose that
\ali{
  \k &= |K|  &
  \l &= |L| &
  \mu &= |M|,
}
where $K$, $L$, and $M$ are mutually disjoint sets.

(a)
\qproof{
  It is obvious that
  $$
    \k + \l = |K \cup L| = |L \cup K| = \l + \k
  $$
  since $K \cup L = L \cup K$ and $K$ and $L$ are disjoint.
}

(b)
\qproof{
  First we note that clearly
  $$
    K \cup (L \cup M) = K \cup L \cup M = (K \cup L) \cup M.
  $$
  Now suppose that there is an $x \in K \cap (L \cup M)$ so that $x \in K$ and $x \in L \cup M$
  If $x \in L$ then $x \in K \cap L$ and if $x \in M$ then $x \in K \cap M$, either of which is a contradiction since all three sets are mutually disjoint.
  Hence $K$ and $L \cup M$ are disjoint.
  A similar argument show that $K \cup L$ and $M$ are disjoint.
  Thus we have the following:
  $$
    \k + (\l + \mu) = |K| + |L \cup M| = |K \cup (L \cup M)| = |(K \cup L) \cup M| = |K \cup L| + |M| = (\k + \l) + \mu
  $$
  as desired.
}

(c)
\qproof{
  Define the function $f: K \to K \cup L$ by simply the identity $f(k) = k$ for any $k \in K$.
  Obviously this is an injective function so that $\k = |K| \leq |K \cup L| = \k + \l$.
}

(d)
\qproof{
  Suppose that
  \ali{
    \k_1 &= |K_1| &
    \k_2 &= |K_2| &
    \l_1 &= |L_1| &
    \l_2 &= |L_2|
  }
  for sets $K_1$, $K_2$, $L_1$, and $L_2$ where $K_1 \cap L_1 = \es$ and $K_2 \cap L_2 = \es$.
  Also suppose that $\k_1 \leq \k_2$ and $\l_1 \leq \l_2$.
  Thus $|K_1| = \k_1 \leq \k_2 = |K_2|$ so that there is an injective function $f$ from $K_1$ to $K_2$.
  Similarly there is an injective function $g : L_1 \to L_2$ since $|L_1| = \l_1 \leq \l_2 = |L_2|$.
  Now define $h : K_1 \cup L_1 \to K_2 \cup L_2$ by
  $$
    h(x) = \begin{cases}
      f(x) & x \in K_1  \\
      g(x) & x \in L_1.
    \end{cases}
  $$
  We show that $h$ is injective so consider $x$ and $y$ in $K_1 \cup L_1$ where $x \neq y$.

  Case: $x \in K_1$, $y \in K_1$.
  Then
  $$
    h(x) = f(x) \neq f(y) = h(y)
  $$
  since $f$ is injective and $x \neq y$.

  Case: $x \in L_1$, $y \in L_1$.
  Then
  $$
    h(x) = g(x) \neq g(y) = h(y)
  $$
  since $g$ is injective and $x \neq y$.

  Case: $x \in K_1$, $y \in L_1$.
  Then we have $h(x) = f(x) \in K_2$ and $h(y) = g(y) \in L_2$ so that $h(x) \neq h(y)$ since $K_2$ and $L_2$ are disjoint.
  Note that this is the same as the case in which $x \in L_1$ and $y \in K_1$ since we simply switch $x$ and $y$.

  Since these cases are exhaustive and $h(x) \neq h(y)$ in each this shows that $h$ is injective.
  Hence we have demonstrated that
  $$
    \k_1 + \l_1 = |K_1 \cup L_1| \leq |K_2 \cup L_2| = \k_2 + \l_2
  $$
  as desired.
}

For solutions (e) through (h) suppose that
\ali{
  \k &= |A| & \l &= |B| & \mu &= |C|
}
for sets $A$, $B$, and $C$.

(e)
\qproof{
  First we show that $|A \times B| = |B \times A|$ by constructing a bijection $f : A \times B \to B \times A$.
  For $(a,b) \in A \times B$ define
  $$
    f(a,b) = (b,a) \in B \times A,
  $$
  which is clearly a function.
  Then for $(a,b) \in A \times B$ and $(c,d) \in A \times B$ where $f(a,b) = f(c,d)$ we have
  $$
    f(a,b) = (b,a) = f(c,d) = (d,c)
  $$
  so that $b=d$ and $a=c$.
  Hence $(a,b) = (c,d)$ so that $f$ is injective.
  Now consider any $(b,a) \in B \times A$ so that clearly $f(a,b) = (b,a)$, noting that $(a,b) \in A \times B$.
  Clearly this shows that $f$ is surjective.

  Hence $f$ is bijective so that
  $$
    \k \cdot \l = |A \times B| = |B \times A| = \l \cdot \k
  $$
  as required.
}

(f)
\qproof{
  Similar part (e) above, it is trivial to find a bijection from $A \times (B \times C)$ to $(A \times B) \times C$ so that
  $$
    \k \cdot (\l \cdot \mu) = |A \times (B \times C)| = |(A \times B) \times C| = (\k \cdot \l) \cdot \mu
  $$
  as desired.
}

(g)
\qproof{
  Here suppose additionally that $B \cap C = \es$.
  First we note that since $B$ and $C$ are disjoint that $A \times B$ and $A \times C$ are also disjoint.
  Suppose that this is not the case so that there is an $(a,b) \in A \times B$ where $(a,b) \in A \times C$ also.
  Then clearly $b \in B$ and $b \in C$, which is a contradiction since they are disjoint.
  Now, it is also trivial to show the equality
  $$
    A \times (B \cup C) = (A \times B) \cup (A \times C).
  $$
  Hence we have that
  $$
    \k \cdot (\l + \mu) = \k \cdot |B \cup C| = |A \times (B \cup C)| = |(A \times B) \cup (A \times C)|
    = |A \times B| + |A \times C| = \k \cdot \l + \k \cdot \mu
  $$
  as desired.
}

(h)
\qproof{
  Here suppose that $\l > 0$  so that $B \neq \es$.
  Here we construct a bijection $f: A \to A \times B$, from which it follows that
  $$
    \k = |A| \leq |A \times B| = \k \cdot \l.
  $$
  Since $B \neq \es$ there exists a $b \in B$.
  So for any $a \in A$ define
  $$
    f(a) = (a, b),
  $$
  which is clearly a function.
  So for $a_1, a_2 \in A$ where $a_1 \neq a_2$ we have that
  $$
    f(a_1) = (a_1, b) \neq (a_2, b) = f(a_2)
  $$
  so that $f$ is injective.
}

(i)
\qproof{
  Suppose that
  \ali{
    \k_1 &= |A_1| & \k_2 &= |A_2| & \l_1 &= |B_1| & \l_2 &= |B_2|
  }
  for sets $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, and $B_2$ where $\k_1 = |A_1| \leq |A_2| = \k_2$ and $\l_1 = |B_1| \leq |B_2| = \l_2$.
  Hence there is an injective function $f: A_1 \to A_2$ and injective function $g: B_1 \to B_2$.
  We shall construct an injective function $h: A_1 \times B_1 \to A_2 \times B_2$ so that it immediately follows that
  $$
    \k_1 \cdot \l_1 = |A_1 \times B_1| \leq |A_2 \times B_2| = \k_2 \cdot \l_2
  $$
  as required.
  So for $(a, b) \in A_1 \times B_1$ define
  $$
    h(a, b) = (f(a), g(b))
  $$
  Suppose then $(a, b) \in A_1 \times B_1$ and $(c, d) \in A_1 \times B_1$ where $(a,b) \neq (c,d)$.
  If $a \neq c$ then $f(a) \neq f(c)$ since $f$ is injective so that
  $$
    h(a,b) = (f(a), g(b)) \neq (f(c), g(d)) = h(c,d)
  $$
  Similarly if $b \neq d$ then $g(b) \neq g(d)$ since $g$ is injective.
  Hence again
  $$
    h(a,b) = (f(a), g(b)) \neq (f(c), g(d)) = h(c,d)
  $$
  Thus in all cases $h(a,b) \neq h(c,d)$ so that $h$ is injective.
}

(j) This is adequately proven in the text.

For solutions (k) through (m) suppose that
\ali{
  \k &= |A| & \l &= |B|
}
for sets $A$ and $B$.

(k)
\qproof{
  Suppose here that $\k \geq 2$.
  Then $2 \leq \k$ and $\k \leq \k$ so that by property (i) we have
  $$
    2 \cdot \k \leq \k \cdot \k.
  $$
  Then by property (j) we have
  $$
    \k + \k = 2 \cdot \k \leq \k \cdot \k
  $$
  as desired.
}

(l)
\qproof{
  Here suppose that $\l = |B| > 0$ so that $B \neq \es$.
  Hence there exists a $b \in B$.
  We shall construct an injective $f: A \to A^B$, from which it follows that
  $$
    \k = |A| \leq |A^B| = \k^\l.
  $$
  So for any $a \in A$ define $f(a) = g$ where $g : B \to A$ is a function defined by $g(b) = a$ for all $b \in B$, noting that $g \neq \es$ since $B \neq \es$.

  Now consider any $a_1, a_2 \in A$ where $a_1 \neq a_2$ so that for any $b \in B$ we have
  $$
    f(a_1)(b) = a_1 \neq a_2 = f(a_2)(b).
  $$
  From this it follows that $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$ so that $f$ is injective.
}

(m)
\qproof{
  Here suppose that $\k = |A| > 1$ so that there are $a_1, a_2 \in A$ where $a_1 \neq a_2$.
  We shall construct an injective function $f: B  \to A^B$ so that
  $$
    \l = |B| \leq |A^B| = \k^\l.
  $$
  So for any $b \in B$ define $f(b) = g$ where $g: B \to A$ is a function defined by
  $$
    g(c) =
    \begin{cases}
      a_1 & c = b    \\
      a_2 & c \neq b
    \end{cases}
  $$
  for $c \in B$.
  Now suppose that $b_1, b_2 \in B$ where $b_1 \neq b_2$.
  We then have
  $$
    f(b_1)(b_1) = a_1 \neq a_2 = f(b_2)(b_1)
  $$
  since $b_1 \neq b_2$.
  From this it follows that $f(b_1) \neq f(b_2)$ so that $f$ is injective.
}

(n)
\qproof{
Suppose that
\ali{
  \k_1 &= |A_1| & \k_2 &= |A_2| & \l_1 &= |B_1| & \l_2 &= |B_2|
}
for sets $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, and $B_2$ where $\k_1 = |A_1| \leq |A_2| = \k_2$ and $\l_1 = |B_1| \leq |B_2| = \l_2$.

The theorem as presented in the text is actually not true in full generality.
As a counterexample suppose that $A_1 = A_2 = B_1 = \es$ so that $\k_1 = \k_2 = \l_1 = 0$ and $B_2 = 1$ so that $\l_2 = 1$.
Then certainly the hypotheses above are true but we also have
$$
  \k_1^{\l_1} = 0^0 = 1 > 0 = 0^1 = \k_2^{\l_2}
$$
where we have used the results of Exercises~5.1.2 and 5.1.3.

However, if we add the restriction that $\k_2 > 0$ then it becomes true.
To prove this first note that this implies that $A_2 \neq \es$ so that there is an $a_2 \in A_2$.
Also there is an injective function $f: A_1 \to A_2$ and an injective function $g: B_1 \to B_2$.
We shall construct an injective $F: A_1^{B_1} \to A_2^{B_2}$, from which it follows that
$$
  \k_1^{\l_1} = |A_1^{B_1}| \leq |A_2^{B_2}| = \k_2^{\l_2}.
$$
So for any $h_1 \in A_1^{B_1}$ define $F(h_1) = h_2$ where $h_2 \in A_2^{B_2}$ is defined by
$$
  h_2(b) = \begin{cases}
    f(h_1(g^{-1}(b))) & b \in \ran(h_1)    \\
    a_2               & b \notin \ran(h_1)
  \end{cases}
$$
for any $b \in B_2$, noting that $g^{-1}$ is a function on $\ran(h_1)$ since $g$ is injective.
Clearly $F$ is a function but now we show that it is injective.

So consider any $h_1, h_2 \in A_1^{B_1}$ where $h_1 \neq h_2$.
Then there is a $b_1 \in B_1$ such that $h_1(b_1) \neq h_2(b_1)$.
So let $b_2 = g(b_1)$ so that clearly $b_2 \in \ran(g)$ and $b_1 = g^{-1}(b_2)$.
Hence we have
$$
  F(h_1)(b_2) = f(h_1(g^{-1}(b_2))) = f(h_1(b_1)) \neq f(h_2(b_1)) = f(h_2(g^{-1}(b_2))) = F(h_2)(b_2)
$$
since $h_1(b_1) \neq h_2(b_1)$ and $f$ is injective.
It thus follows that $F(h_1) \neq F(h_2)$ so that we have shown that $F$ is injective.

\exercise{2}{
  Show that $\k^0 = 1$ and $\k^1 = \k$ for all $\k$.
}
\sol{
  \qproof{
    Suppose that $\k = |A|$ for a set $A$.

    We claim that $A^\es = \braces{\es} = 1$ so that clearly
    $$
      \k^0 = |A^\es| = |1| = 1.
    $$
    First consider any $f \in A^\es$.
    Suppose that $f \neq \es$ so that there is a $(b,a) \in f \subseteq \es \times A$.
    But then $b \in \es$, which is a contradiction.
    Hence $f = \es$.
    So if there are any $f \in A^\es$ then $f = \es$ but are there any $f \in A^\es$?
    Clearly the empty set is a function from $\es$ to $A$ since it is vacuously true that for every $b \in \es$ there is a unique $a \in A$ such that $(b,a) \in \es$.
    Hence $\es \in A^\es$ so that $A^\es = \braces{\es} = 1$.

    We also claim that $|A^1| = |A|$ so that
    $$
      \k^1 = |A^1| = |A| = \k.
    $$
    To this end for any $f \in A^1$ define $F(f) = f(\es)$, noting that $1 = \braces{\es}$, so that clearly $F: A^1 \to A$.
    Now consider any $f,g \in A^1$ where $f \neq g$.
    Then it has to be that
    $$
      F(f) = f(\es) \neq g(\es) = F(g)
    $$
    so that $F$ is injective.
    Now consider any $a \in A$ and define $f \in A^1$ by $f(\es) = a$.
    Then clearly
    $$
      F(f) = f(\es) = a
    $$
    so that $F$ is surjective.
    Hence we've shown that $F$ is bijective.

  Show that $1^\k = 1$ for all $\k$ and $0^\k = 0$ for all $\k > 0$.
}
\sol{
  \qproof{
    Suppose that $\k = |A|$ for a set $A$.

    Note first that if $\k = 0$ then by Exercise~5.1.2 it follows that
    $$
      1^\k = 1^0 = 1.
    $$
    In the case where $\k > 0$ we claim that there is a unique $f \in 1^A$ so that clearly then
    $$
      1^\k = |1^A| = 1.
    $$
    For existence define $f:A \to 1$ by $f(x) = \es$ for all $x \in A$ so that clearly $f \in 1^A$.
    For uniqueness consider any $f_1, f_2 \in 1^A$.
    Since $1 = \braces{\es}$ it has to be that $f_1(x) = f_2(x) = \es$ for all $x \in A$.
    Hence $f_1 = f_2$.

    Now suppose also that $\k > 0$ so that $A \neq \es$.
    Hence there is an $a \in A$.
    We claim that in this case that $\es^A = \es$ so that
    $$
      0^\k = |\es^A| = |\es| = 0.
    $$
    So suppose that $\es^A \neq \es$ so that there \emph{is} an $f \in \es^A$.
    Then it's true that for every $a \in A$ there is a unique $b \in \es$ such that $f(a) = b$.
    But since there \emph{is} an $a \in A$ this implies that there is also a $b \in \es$, which is a contradiction.
    Hence there can be no $f \in \es^A$ so that $\es^A = \es$.

  Prove that $\k^\k \leq 2^{\k \cdot \k}$.

\qproof{
Suppose that $\k = |A|$ for a set $A$.
Then we construct an injective $F : A^A \to 2^{A \times A}$ so that
$$
  \k^\k = |A^A| \leq |2^{A \times A}| = |2|^{|A \times A|} = 2^{\k \cdot \k}.

So for any $f \in A^A$ define $F(f) = g$ where $g \in 2^{A\times A}$ is defined by

for $(a_1, a_2) \in A \times A$.
To show that $F$ is injective consider any $f,g \in A^A$ where $f \neq g$.
Then there is an $a \in A$ such that $f(a) \neq g(a)$.
Now let $a_1 = f(a)$ and $a_2 = g(a)$ so that
$$
  f(a) = a_1 \neq a_2 = g(a).

Since $f(a) = a_1$ it follows by definition that $F(f)(a,a_1) = 1$.
Similarly since $g(a) = a_2  \neq a_1$ it follows that $F(g)(a,a_1) = 0$.
Hence we have
$$
  F(f)(a, a_1) = 1 \neq 0 = F(g)(a, a_1)

so that clearly $F(f) \neq F(g)$.
Thus $F$ is injective.

    We also note that clearly $g^{-1} : X \to n$ is also a bijection.
    Now define a function $h : n \to n$ by
    $$
      h(k) = (g^{-1} \circ f \circ g)(k) = g^{-1}(f(g(k))
    $$
    for any $k \in n$.
    Since $g$, $f$, and $g^{-1}$ are all injective it follows from Exercise~2.3.5 that $h$ is also injective.

    We now claim that $\ran(h)$ is proper subset of $n$.
    First we note that for any $m \in n$ we have
    $$
      g(h(m)) = g(g^{-1}(f(g(m)))) = f(g(m))
    $$
    since $g$ is a function.
    Now, since $\ran(f) \subset X$ there is an $x \in X$ such that $x \notin \ran(f)$.
    So let $k = g^{-1}(x)$ so that $g(k) = x$.
    Now suppose that there is an $m \in n$ such that $h(m) = k$.
    Then per the above we have
    $$
      f(g(m)) = g(h(m)) = g(k) = x,
    $$
    which is impossible since $x \notin \ran(f)$.
    So it must be that there is no such $m$ so that $k \notin \ran(h)$
    Hence since $k \in n$ it follows that $\ran(g) \subset n$.

    Now clearly $h$ is a surjective mapping from $n$ to $\ran(h)$.
    But since $h$ is also injective it is thus a bijection from $n$ to $\ran(n)$.
    However, according to Lemma~4.2.2 there is no bijective mapping from $n$ to $\ran(n)$ since $\ran(h) \subset n$.
    We have thus arrived at a contradiction so that, if the hypotheses hold, then $X$ cannot be finite.
    Hence by definition $X$ is infinite.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:card:equidede}
  If sets $X$ and $Y$ are equipotent (i.e. $|X| = |Y|$) and $Y$ is Dedekind infinite then $X$ is also Dedekind infinite.
\end{lem}
\qproof{
Since $X$ and $Y$ are equipotent there is a bijective $f : X \to Y$ so that $\inv{f}$ is also bijective.
Also since $Y$ is Dedekind infinite there is a $Z \subset Y$ such that there is a bijective $g : Y \to Z$ so that $\inv{g}$ is also bijective.
So since $Z \subset Y$ there is a $y \in Y$ such that $y \notin Z$.
So let $S = X - \braces{\inv{f}(y)}$.
Clearly since $\inv{f}(y) \in X$ it follows that $S \subset X$ since $\inv{f}(y) \notin S$.
Now define $h: X \to S$ by
$$
  h(x) = (\inv{f} \circ g \circ f)(x) = \inv{f}(g(f(x))))
$$
for $x \in X$.
Since $f$ is a function this implies that
$$
  f(h(x)) = f(\inv{f}(g(f(x)))) = g(f(x)).
$$
Now suppose for a moment that there is an $x \in X$ such that $h(x) = \inv{f}(y)$.
Then
$$
  g(f(x)) = f(h(x)) = f(\inv{f}(y)) = y,
$$
which is impossible since $y \notin Z$ but $\ran(g) \subseteq Z$.
Hence there is no such $x$ so that $h$ really is a map from $X$ to $S$ (as opposed to $X$ to $X$).

Now, since $\inv{f}$, $g$, and $f$ are all injective it follows from Exercise~2.3.5 that $h$ is injective as well.
Then consider any $s \in S$ and let $x = \inv{f}(\inv{g}(f(s)))$, noting that $\inv{g}(f(s))$ exists since $s \neq \inv{f}(y)$.
Then we have
$$
h(x) = \inv{f}(g(f(\inv{f}(\inv{g}(f(s))))))) = \inv{f}(g(\inv{g}(f(s)))) = \inv{f}(f(s)) = s
$$
so that $h$ is surjective since $s$ was arbitrary.
Hence $h$ is a bijective map from $X$ to $S$, and since $S \subset X$ this means that $X$ is Dedekind infinite.

  $\nats$ is Dedekind infinite.

  Let $N = \nats - \braces{0}$ so that clearly $N$ is proper subset of $\nats$.
  Then we define the map $f : \nats \to N$ by
  $$
    f(n) = n+1

  for $n \in \nats$.
  Consider any $n,m \in \nats$ where $n \neq m$.
  Then clearly
  \gath{
    n \neq m \\
    n+1 \neq m+1 \\
    f(n) \neq f(m)

  so that $f$ is injective.
  Now consider any $n \in N$ so that clearly $f(n-1) = (n-1) + 1 = n$, noting that since $n \neq 0$ we have $n \geq 1$ so that $n-1 \geq 0$.
  Hence $n-1 \in \nats$.
  This shows that $f$ is surjective.
  Hence $f$ is a bijection from $\nats$ onto a proper subset $N$ so that by definition $\nats$ is Dedekind infinite.

  If $X$ contains a countable subset, then $X$ is Dedekind infinite.

  \qproof{
    Suppose that $X$ is a set with a countable subset $Y$.
    Then by Exercise~5.1.9 $Y$ is Dedekind infinite so that there is a $Z \subset Y \subseteq X$ such that there is a bijective $f : Y \to Z$.
    So define the following $g: X \to X$ by
    $$
      g(x) = \begin{cases}
        f(x) & x \in Y    \\
        x    & x \notin Y
      \end{cases}
    $$
    for any $x \in X$.
    Now since $Z \subset Y$ there is a $y \in Y$ such that $y \notin Z$, noting that since $Y \subseteq X$, $y \in X$.

    First we claim that $y \notin \ran(g)$.
    So suppose that it is so that there is an $x \in X$ such that $g(x) = y$.
    If $x \in Y$ then by definition $g(x) = f(x) = y$, but this is a contradiction since $f : Y \to Z$ but $y \notin Z$.
    On the other hand if $x \notin Y$ then we have $g(x) = x = y$, which is also a contradiction since $y = x \in Y$.
    Since a contradiction follows in either case it must be that there is no such $x$ so that $y \notin \ran(g)$.
    Hence $\ran(g) \subset X$.

    Clearly $g$ is a surjective map from $X$ to $\ran(g)$ so we now show that it is injective.
    So consider any $x_1, x_2 \in X$ where $x_1 \neq x_2$.

    Case: $x_1 \in Y$ and $x_2 \in Y$.
    Then
    $$
      g(x_1) = f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) = g(x_2)
    $$
    since $f$ is injective.

    Case: $x_1 \notin Y$ and $x_2 \notin Y$.
    Then
    $$
      g(x_1) = x_1 \neq x_2 = g(x_2).
    $$

    Case: $x_1 \in Y$ and $x_2 \notin Y$.
    Then $g(x_1) = f(x_1) \in Z$ but $g(x_2) = x_2 \notin Y$ so that  $x_2 \notin Z$ either since $Z \subset Y$.
    Hence $f(x_1) \neq x_2$ so that
    $$
      g(x_1) = f(x_1) \neq x_2 = g(x_2).
    $$
    Thus in all cases $g(x_1) \neq g(x_2)$ so that $g$ is injective since $x_1$ and $x_2$ were arbitrary.

    Therefore we have shown that $g$ is a bijective map from $X$ to $\ran(g) \subset X$ so that $X$ is Dedekind infinite by definition.

  \qproof{
    Suppose that $X$ is a Dedekind infinite set.
    Then there is a $Y \subset X$ such that there is a bijective $f : X \to Y$.
    Since $Y \subset X$ there is an $x \in X$ such that $x \notin Y$.
    So first define $x_0 = x$ and then for $n \in \nats$ define $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$.

    We claim that $x_n \neq x_m$ for any $n,m \in \nats$ where $n \neq m$, from which it clearly follows that
    $$
      Z = \braces{x_n \where n \in \nats}
    $$
    is a countable set.
    So consider any $n,m \in \nats$ where $n \neq m$
    Without loss of generality we can assume that $n < m$.
    Suppose that  $x_n = x_m$.
    We now show by induction that $x_{n-k} = x_{m-k}$ for all $n \geq k \geq 0$.
    If $k=0$ then we clearly have
    $$
      x_{n-k} = x_{n-0} = x_n = x_m = x_{m-0} = x_{m-k}.
    $$
    Now suppose that $x_{n-k} = x_{m-k}$.
    We then have
    $$
      f(x_{n-(k+1)}) = f(x_{n-k-1}) = x_{n-k} = x_{m-k} = f(x_{m-k-1}) = f(x_{m-(k+1)})
    $$
    Since $f$ is injective this implies that $x_{n-(k+1)} = x_{m-(k+1)}$ so that inductive proof is complete.
    So since this holds for $k=n$ we have that
    $$
      x_0 = x_{n-n} = x_{m-n} = f(x_{m-n-1}),
    $$
    Noting that $m-n-1 \geq 0$ since $m \geq n +1$.
    But $x_0 = x \notin Y$ and $f(x_{m-n-1}) \in Y$ since $f:X \to Y$ so that we have a contradiction.
    So it must be that $x_n \neq x_m$.
    Hence $Z$ is countable.
    Since also clearly $Z \subseteq X$ the proof is complete.
