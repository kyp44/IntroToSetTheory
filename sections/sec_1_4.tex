    For commutivity, Venn diagrams are not very useful.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have that
        \comproof{\cap}{\land}
        which shows that $A \cap B = B \cap A$.
        Similarly, we have that
        \comproof{\cup}{\lor}
        which proves that $A \cup B = B \cup A$.
    }

    Venn diagrams also provide no insight for associativity.
    \qproof{
        Again, for any $x$, we have that
        \assocproof{\cap}{\land}
        showing that $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$.
        Likewise, we have
        \assocproof{\cup}{\lor}
        and hence $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$.

    For distributivity, Venn diagrams \emph{do} provide insight.
    The Venn diagram for the distributive identity $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$ is shown below:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{1}
    A proof of this follows directly from the distributivity of logical conjunction.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have
        \distproof{\cap}{\cup}{\land}{\lor}
        which proves the result.
    }
    Likewise, the Venn diagram for $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ is shown below:
    \venndiag{1}{0}{0}{1}{1}{1}{1}
    This time, the proof follows directly from the distributivity of logical disjunction.
    \qproof{
        For every $x$, we have that
        \distproof{\cup}{\cap}{\lor}{\land}
        proving the desired result.
    }

    \newcommand\demorgproof[4]{
        \ali{
            x \in C - (A #1 B) &\bic x \in C \land x \notin A #1 B \\
            &\bic x \in C \land \lnot (x \in A #1 B) \\
            &\bic x \in C \land \lnot (x \in A #2 x \in B) \\
            &\bic x \in C \land (x \notin A #3 x \notin B) \\
            &\bic (x \in C \land x \notin A) #3 (x \in C \land x \notin B) \\
            &\bic x \in C - A #3 x \in C - B \\
            &\bic x \in (C - A) #4 (C - B),
        }
    }
    Regarding the two DeMorgan laws, proofs of these rely on the DeMorgan and distributive laws of logic.
    First, we have $C - (A \cap B) = (C - A) \cup (C - B)$:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \qproof{
        For all $x$,
        \demorgproof{\cap}{\land}{\lor}{\cup}
        of course showing the result.
    }
    The other DeMorgan law is of course $C - (A \cup B) = (C - A) \cap (C - B)$:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \qproof{
        Again, for all $x$, we have
        \demorgproof{\cup}{\lor}{\land}{\cap}
        which proves the result.
    }

    Next, we have the property $A \cap (B - C) = (A \cap B) - C$, which is visualized below:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    The proof of this follows from the associativity of logical conjunction.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have
        \ali{
            x \in A \cap (B - C) &\bic x \in A \land x \in B - C \\
            &\bic x \in A \land (x \in B \land x \notin C) \\
            &\bic (x \in A \land x \in B) \land x \notin C \\
            &\bic x \in A \cap B \land x \notin C \\
            &\bic x \in (A \cap B) - C,
        }
        showing the result.
    }

    The next claim is that $A - B = \es$ if and only if $A \ss B$, for which a Venn diagram is not useful.
    \qproof{
        $(\to)$ First suppose that $A - B = \es$ and consider any $x \in A$.
        Suppose that $x \notin B$.
        Then we would have $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$ so that $x \in A - B$, contradicting the fact that $A - B = \es$.
        Hence, it has to be that $x \in B$ so that $A \ss B$ since $x$ was arbitrary.

        $(\leftarrow)$ Now suppose that $A \ss B$ but that $A - B \neq \es$ so that there is an  $x \in A - B$.
        Therefore, $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$.
        However, since $A \ss B$ it must also be that $x \in B$ since $x \in A$, a contradiction!
        So it in fact has to be that $A - B = \es$ as desired.
    }

    To prove the next property, it is first useful to establish the following lemma.
    \begin{lem}
        For any set $A$, $A - A = \es$.
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        This is very nearly self-evident, but suppose $A - A \neq \es$ so that there is an $x \in A - A$.
        Then it would both be true that $x \in A$ and $x \notin A$.
        As this is a clear contradiction, it has to be that in fact $A - A = \es$ as claimed.
    }
    The next property is then that $A \sd A = \es$, for which again a Venn diagram provides no insight and in fact does not really even make sense.
    \qproof{
        By definition and the above lemma,
        \gath{
            A \sd A = (A - A) \cup (A - A) = \es \cup \es = \es.
        }
        Clearly $\es \cup \es = \es$ since, were there an $x \in \es \cup \es$, we would have $x \in \es$ or $x \in \es$, the same impossibility in either case.
    }

    The penultimate property asserted in this section is that $A \sd B = B \sd A$.
    \qproof{
        This follows trivially from the commutativity of the union operation, proven above.
        By definition, we simply have
        \gath{
            A \sd B = (A - B) \cup (B - A) = (B - A) \cup (A - B) = B \sd A.
        }
    }

    The final property is $(A \sd B) \sd C = A \sd (B \sd C)$, i.e. that the symmetric difference operation is associative.
    This set is visualized below:
    \venndiag{1}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    The proof of this is tedious and depends on several of the various properties we have proven above.
    \qproof{
        We have the following:
        \ali{
            (A \sd B) \sd C &= \squares{(A - B) \cup (B - A)} \sd C & \text{Definition of $\sd$} \\
            &= \braces{\squares{(A - B) \cup (B - A)} - C} \cup \braces{C - \squares{(A - B) \cup (B - A)}} & \text{Definition of $\sd$} \\
            &= A \veebar B
        }
    }
}
