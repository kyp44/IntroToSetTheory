    }
    For commutivity, Venn diagrams are not very useful.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have that
        \comproof{\cap}{\land}
        which shows that $A \cap B = B \cap A$.
        Similarly, we have that
        \comproof{\cup}{\lor}
        which proves that $A \cup B = B \cup A$.
    }

    Venn diagrams also provide no insight for associativity.
    \qproof{
        Again, for any $x$, we have that
        \assocproof{\cap}{\land}
        showing that $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$.
        Likewise, we have
        \assocproof{\cup}{\lor}
        and hence $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$.
    }

    \newcommand*{\distproof}[4]{
        \ali{
            x \in A #1 (B #2 C) &\bic x \in A #3 (x \in B #4 x \in C) \\
            &\bic (x \in A #3 x \in B) #4 (x \in A #3 x \in C) \\
            &\bic x \in A #1 B #4 x \in A #1 C \\
            &\bic x \in (A #1 B) #2 (A #1 C),
        }
    }
    For distributivity, Venn diagrams \emph{do} provide insight.
    The Venn diagram for the distributive identity $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$ is shown below:
    \venndiagiii{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{1}
    A proof of this follows directly from the distributivity of logical conjunction.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have
        \distproof{\cap}{\cup}{\land}{\lor}
        which proves the result.
    }
    Likewise, the Venn diagram for $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ is shown below:
    \venndiagiii{1}{0}{0}{1}{1}{1}{1}
    This time, the proof follows directly from the distributivity of logical disjunction.
    \qproof{
        For every $x$, we have that
        \distproof{\cup}{\cap}{\lor}{\land}
        proving the desired result.
    }

    \newcommand\demorgproof[4]{
        \ali{
            x \in C - (A #1 B) &\bic x \in C \land x \notin A #1 B \\
            &\bic x \in C \land \lnot (x \in A #1 B) \\
            &\bic x \in C \land \lnot (x \in A #2 x \in B) \\
            &\bic x \in C \land (x \notin A #3 x \notin B) \\
            &\bic (x \in C \land x \notin A) #3 (x \in C \land x \notin B) \\
            &\bic x \in C - A #3 x \in C - B \\
            &\bic x \in (C - A) #4 (C - B),
        }
    }
    Regarding the two DeMorgan laws, proofs of these rely on the DeMorgan and distributive laws of logic.
    First, we have $C - (A \cap B) = (C - A) \cup (C - B)$:
    \venndiagiii{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \qproof{
        For all $x$,
        \demorgproof{\cap}{\land}{\lor}{\cup}
        of course showing the result.
    }
    The other DeMorgan law is of course $C - (A \cup B) = (C - A) \cap (C - B)$:
    \venndiagiii{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \qproof{
        Again, for all $x$, we have
        \demorgproof{\cup}{\lor}{\land}{\cap}
        which proves the result.
    }

    Next, we have the property $A \cap (B - C) = (A \cap B) - C$, which is visualized below:
    \venndiagiii{0}{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    The proof of this follows from the associativity of logical conjunction.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have
        \ali{
            x \in A \cap (B - C) &\bic x \in A \land x \in B - C \\
            &\bic x \in A \land (x \in B \land x \notin C) \\
            &\bic (x \in A \land x \in B) \land x \notin C \\
            &\bic x \in A \cap B \land x \notin C \\
            &\bic x \in (A \cap B) - C,
        }
        showing the result.
    }

    The next claim is that $A - B = \es$ if and only if $A \ss B$, for which a Venn diagram is not useful.
    \qproof{
        \bicproof{
            First suppose that $A - B = \es$ and consider any $x \in A$.
            Suppose that $x \notin B$.
            Then we would have $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$ so that $x \in A - B$, contradicting the fact that $A - B = \es$.
            Hence, it has to be that $x \in B$ so that $A \ss B$ since $x$ was arbitrary.
        }{
            Now suppose that $A \ss B$ but that $A - B \neq \es$ so that there is an  $x \in A - B$.
            Therefore, $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$.
            However, since $A \ss B$ it must also be that $x \in B$ since $x \in A$, a contradiction!
            So it in fact has to be that $A - B = \es$ as desired.
        }
    }

    To prove the next property, it is first useful to establish the following lemma.
    \begin{lem}
        For any set $A$, $A - A = \es$.
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        This is very nearly self-evident, but suppose $A - A \neq \es$ so that there is an $x \in A - A$.
        Then it would both be true that $x \in A$ and $x \notin A$.
        As this is a clear contradiction, it has to be that in fact $A - A = \es$ as claimed.
    }
    The next property is then that $A \sd A = \es$, for which again a Venn diagram provides no insight and in fact does not really even make sense.
    \qproof{
        By definition and the above lemma,
        \gath{
            A \sd A = (A - A) \cup (A - A) = \es \cup \es = \es.
        }
        Clearly $\es \cup \es = \es$ since, were there an $x \in \es \cup \es$, we would have $x \in \es$ or $x \in \es$, the same impossibility in either case.
    }

    The penultimate property asserted in this section is that $A \sd B = B \sd A$.
    \qproof{
        This follows trivially from the commutativity of the union operation, proven above.
        By definition, we simply have
        \gath{
            A \sd B = (A - B) \cup (B - A) = (B - A) \cup (A - B) = B \sd A.
        }
    }

    The final property is $(A \sd B) \sd C = A \sd (B \sd C)$, i.e. that the symmetric difference operation is associative.
    This set is visualized below:
    \venndiagiii{1}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    In order to prove this while avoiding great tedium, we introduce the logical ``exclusive or'' operation, also called XOR.
    The reader may already have some familiarity with this operation, but for propositions $P$ and $Q$, we denote the XOR of $P$ and $Q$ as $P \lxor Q$.
    The XOR operation is defined by the following truth table:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{cc|c}
            $P$ & $Q$ & $P \lxor Q$ \\
            \hline
            F   & F   & F           \\
            F   & T   & T           \\
            T   & F   & T           \\
            T   & T   & F
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \begin{lem}\label{lem:oper:xorid}
        We claim the logical identity $P \lxor Q \bic (P \land \lnot Q) \lor (Q \land \lnot P)$
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        To prove this, we work out the truth table for the right-hand side, in which we set $R = (P \land \lnot Q) \lor (Q \land \lnot P)$ for brevity:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{cc|cc|cc|c}
                $P$ & $Q$ & $\lnot P$ & $\lnot Q$ & $P \land \lnot Q$ & $Q \land \lnot P$ & $R$ \\
                \hline
                F   & F   & T         & T         & F                 & F                 & F   \\
                F   & T   & T         & F         & F                 & T                 & T   \\
                T   & F   & F         & T         & T                 & F                 & T   \\
                T   & T   & F         & F         & F                 & F                 & F
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        Since the truth table for $R$ is identical to that for $P \lxor Q$ above, this proves the identity.
    }
    \begin{lem}\label{lem:oper:xorassoc}
        The logical XOR operation is associative, that is that $(P \lxor Q) \lxor R \bic P \lxor (Q \lxor R)$.
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        This is again most easily proved via exhaustive truth tables:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc|c|c}
                $P$ & $Q$ & $R$ & $P \lxor Q$ & $(P \lxor Q) \lxor R$ \\
                \hline
                F   & F   & F   & F           & F                     \\
                F   & F   & T   & F           & T                     \\

        \begin{center}

        For any $x$, $x$ is \emph{not} a member of $A - B$ if and only if $x \notin A$ or $x \in B$.
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        This is shown with some basic rules of logic.
        For any $x$, we have
        \ali{
            x \notin A - B &\bic \lnot(x \in A - B) & \\

            &\bic x \notin \lor x \in B, & \text{DeMorgan law for logical conjunction}
        }
        and it is as simple as that.
    }
    Now we can prove the desired result.
    \qproof{
        Consider any $x$.
        Let $F$ be the proposition that $x \in A$ and $x \notin A$, which is of course \emph{always} false.
        We then have
        \ali{

    (f) \qproof{

        Suppose that the complement of $A$ exist, and denote it by $\Ac$.

        Furthermore, the set $V = \braces{X \in A \cup \Ac \where \text{$X$ is a set}}$ then uniquely exists by the Axiom Schema of Comprehension.

        Now consider any set $X$ so that either $X \in A$ or $X \notin A$.
        In the latter case of course $X \in \Ac$ by definition so that, either way, $X \in A \cup \Ac$.

            Consider any $x \in A - \bigcup S$ so that $x \in A$ but $x \notin \bigcup S$.

            To digress for a moment, consider any $X \in S$ and set $Y = A - X$.
            Since any $y \in Y$ is also in $A$ we have $Y \ss A$ and thus $Y \in \pset{A}$.
            Since also of course $Y = A - X$ where $X \in S$, we have that $Y \in T_2$ by definition so that $x \in Y$ because $x \in \bigcap T_2$.

        First we note that $S$ is not empty so that $\bigcap S$ exists (refer to the next exercise).

            As before, clearly $Y \in \pset{A}$.
            Since also $Y = A - X$ and $X \in S$, it is necessary that $Y \in T_2$.
            From this it follows that $x \in \bigcup T_2$ since we have already shown the $x \in Y$.
            Therefore, $A - \bigcap S \ss \bigcup T_2$ since $x$ was arbitrary.
        }{
            Now consider any $x \in \bigcup T_2$ so that there is a $Y \in T_2$ such that $x \in Y$.
            Then, by the definition of $T_2$, $Y = A - X$ for some $X \in S$.
            Then, since $x \in Y = A - X$, we have that $x \in A$ and $x \notin X$.
            Since $X \in S$ and $x \notin X$, it cannot be that $x$ is a member of $\bigcap S$.
            Since also $x \in A$, clearly $x \in A - \bigcap S$, and hence $\bigcup T_2 \ss A - \bigcap S$ as desired.

    Prove that $\bigcap S$ exists for all $S \neq \es$.
    Where is the assumption that $S \neq \es$ used in the proof?
}
\sol{
    \qproof{
        Suppose that $S \neq \es$ so that there is a set $X \in S$ (since sets are all that exist by the axioms).
        We then define the set
        \gath{
            \bigcap S = \braces{x \in X \where \text{$x \in A$ for every $A \in S$}},
        }
        noting that this exists by the Axiom Schema of Comprehension.
        The uniqueness of this set follows immediately from the Axiom of Extensionality.
    }
    The non-emptiness of $S$ was used to produce a set to which the Axiom Schema of Comprehension could be applied to further limit it.
    This works because the intersection of all the sets in $S$ (i.e. $\bigcap S$) is a subset of \emph{every} set in $S$.
    Hence, with this proof, $S$ being nonempty is required in order for $\bigcap S$ to exist.

    Note that we could have defined it and shown its existence differently and a little more generally:
    \qproof{
        Suppose that $S$ is any set (which could possibly be empty).
        By the Axiom of Union, the set $\bigcup S$ exists so that the set
        \gath{
            \bigcap S = \braces{x \in \bigcup S \where \text{$x \in A$ for every $A \in S$}},
        }
        exists by the Axiom Schema of Comprehension, where its uniqueness again follows immediately from the Axiom Schema of Comprehension.
    }
    The intersection $\bigcap S$ defined this way exists even if $S = \es$, and is in fact empty in this case since $\bigcup S$ is empty.
    Mathematicians have chosen the former definition in which $\bigcap S$ exists only when $S$ nonempty.
    The reason is that we would like $\bigcap S$ to represent the naive set
    \gath{
        \bigcap S = \braces{x \where \text{$x \in A$ for every $A \in S$}},
    }
    but this is problematic if $S$ is empty because the defining property is then vacuously true for \emph{any} $x$ so that $\bigcap S$ would therefore contain \emph{every} set, which we know results in a contradiction.
