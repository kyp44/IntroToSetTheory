    For commutivity, Venn diagrams are not very useful.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have that
        \comproof{\cap}{\land}
        which shows that $A \cap B = B \cap A$.
        Similarly, we have that
        \comproof{\cup}{\lor}
        which proves that $A \cup B = B \cup A$.
    }

    Venn diagrams also provide no insight for associativity.
    \qproof{
        Again, for any $x$, we have that
        \assocproof{\cap}{\land}
        showing that $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$.
        Likewise, we have
        \assocproof{\cup}{\lor}
        and hence $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$.

    For distributivity, Venn diagrams \emph{do} provide insight.
    The Venn diagram for the distributive identity $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$ is shown below:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{1}
    A proof of this follows directly from the distributivity of logical conjunction.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have
        \distproof{\cap}{\cup}{\land}{\lor}
        which proves the result.
    }
    Likewise, the Venn diagram for $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ is shown below:
    \venndiag{1}{0}{0}{1}{1}{1}{1}
    This time, the proof follows directly from the distributivity of logical disjunction.
    \qproof{
        For every $x$, we have that
        \distproof{\cup}{\cap}{\lor}{\land}
        proving the desired result.
    }

    \newcommand\demorgproof[4]{
        \ali{
            x \in C - (A #1 B) &\bic x \in C \land x \notin A #1 B \\

            &\bic x \in C \land \lnot (x \in A #2 x \in B) \\
            &\bic x \in C \land (x \notin A #3 x \notin B) \\
            &\bic (x \in C \land x \notin A) #3 (x \in C \land x \notin B) \\
            &\bic x \in C - A #3 x \in C - B \\
            &\bic x \in (C - A) #4 (C - B),
        }
    }
    Regarding the two DeMorgan laws, proofs of these rely on the DeMorgan and distributive laws of logic.
    First, we have $C - (A \cap B) = (C - A) \cup (C - B)$:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \qproof{
        For all $x$,
        \demorgproof{\cap}{\land}{\lor}{\cup}
        of course showing the result.
    }
    The other DeMorgan law is of course $C - (A \cup B) = (C - A) \cap (C - B)$:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \qproof{
        Again, for all $x$, we have
        \demorgproof{\cup}{\lor}{\land}{\cap}
        which proves the result.
    }

    Next, we have the property $A \cap (B - C) = (A \cap B) - C$, which is visualized below:
    \venndiag{0}{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    The proof of this follows from the associativity of logical conjunction.
    \qproof{
        For all $x$, we have
        \ali{
            x \in A \cap (B - C) &\bic x \in A \land x \in B - C \\
            &\bic x \in A \land (x \in B \land x \notin C) \\
            &\bic (x \in A \land x \in B) \land x \notin C \\
            &\bic x \in A \cap B \land x \notin C \\
            &\bic x \in (A \cap B) - C,
        }
        showing the result.
    }

    The next claim is that $A - B = \es$ if and only if $A \ss B$, for which a Venn diagram is not useful.
    \qproof{
        $(\to)$ First suppose that $A - B = \es$ and consider any $x \in A$.
        Suppose that $x \notin B$.
        Then we would have $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$ so that $x \in A - B$, contradicting the fact that $A - B = \es$.
        Hence, it has to be that $x \in B$ so that $A \ss B$ since $x$ was arbitrary.

        $(\leftarrow)$ Now suppose that $A \ss B$ but that $A - B \neq \es$ so that there is an  $x \in A - B$.
        Therefore, $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$.
        However, since $A \ss B$ it must also be that $x \in B$ since $x \in A$, a contradiction!
        So it in fact has to be that $A - B = \es$ as desired.
    }

    To prove the next property, it is first useful to establish the following lemma.
    \begin{lem}
        For any set $A$, $A - A = \es$.
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        This is very nearly self-evident, but suppose $A - A \neq \es$ so that there is an $x \in A - A$.
        Then it would both be true that $x \in A$ and $x \notin A$.
        As this is a clear contradiction, it has to be that in fact $A - A = \es$ as claimed.
    }
    The next property is then that $A \sd A = \es$, for which again a Venn diagram provides no insight and in fact does not really even make sense.
    \qproof{
        By definition and the above lemma,
        \gath{
            A \sd A = (A - A) \cup (A - A) = \es \cup \es = \es.
        }
        Clearly $\es \cup \es = \es$ since, were there an $x \in \es \cup \es$, we would have $x \in \es$ or $x \in \es$, the same impossibility in either case.
    }

    The penultimate property asserted in this section is that $A \sd B = B \sd A$.
    \qproof{
        This follows trivially from the commutativity of the union operation, proven above.
        By definition, we simply have
        \gath{
            A \sd B = (A - B) \cup (B - A) = (B - A) \cup (A - B) = B \sd A.
        }
    }

    The final property is $(A \sd B) \sd C = A \sd (B \sd C)$, i.e. that the symmetric difference operation is associative.
    This set is visualized below:
    \venndiag{1}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    In order to prove this while avoiding great tedium, we introduce the logical ``exclusive or'' operation, also called XOR.
    The reader may already have some familiarity with this operation, but for propositions $P$ and $Q$, we denote the XOR of $P$ and $Q$ as $P \lxor Q$.
    The XOR operation is defined by the following truth table:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{cc|c}
            $P$ & $Q$ & $P \lxor Q$ \\
            \hline
            F   & F   & F           \\
            F   & T   & T           \\
            T   & F   & T           \\
            T   & T   & F
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \begin{lem}\label{lem:oper:xorid}
        We claim the logical identity $P \lxor Q \bic (P \land \lnot Q) \lor (Q \land \lnot P)$
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        To prove this, we work out the truth table for the right-hand side, in which we set $R = (P \land \lnot Q) \lor (Q \land \lnot P)$ for brevity:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{cc|cc|cc|c}
                $P$ & $Q$ & $\lnot P$ & $\lnot Q$ & $P \land \lnot Q$ & $Q \land \lnot P$ & $R$ \\
                \hline
                F   & F   & T         & T         & F                 & F                 & F   \\
                F   & T   & T         & F         & F                 & T                 & T   \\
                T   & F   & F         & T         & T                 & F                 & T   \\
                T   & T   & F         & F         & F                 & F                 & F
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        Since the truth table for $R$ is identical to that for $P \lxor Q$ above, this proves the identity.
    }
    \begin{lem}\label{lem:oper:xorassoc}
        The logical XOR operation is associative, that is that $(P \lxor Q) \lxor R \bic P \lxor (Q \lxor R)$.
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        This is again most easily proved via exhaustive truth tables:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc|c|c}
                $P$ & $Q$ & $R$ & $P \lxor Q$ & $(P \lxor Q) \lxor R$ \\
                \hline
                F   & F   & F   & F           & F                     \\

                F   & T   & F   & T           & T                     \\
                F   & T   & T   & T           & F                     \\

            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        \pagebreak
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{ccc|c|c}
                $P$ & $Q$ & $R$ & $Q \lxor R$ & $P \lxor (Q \lxor R)$ \\

            \end{tabular}

        Since the final column of both tables are identical, this shows the desired result.
    }
    \begin{lem}\label{lem:oper:sdxor}
        For sets $A$ and $B$ and any $x$, $x \in A \sd B$ if and only if $x \in A \lxor x \in B$.
    \end{lem}
    \qproof{
        For any $x$, define the proposition $P$ as $x \in A$ and $Q$ as $x \in B$.
        Then we have that
        \ali{
            x \in A \sd B &\bic x \in (A -  B) \cup (B - A) & \text{Definition of $\sd$} \\
            &\bic x \in A - B \lor x \in B - A & \text{Definition of union} \\
            &\bic (x \in A \land x \notin B) \lor (x \in B \land x \notin A) & \text{Definition of set difference} \\

            &\bic x \in A \lxor x \in B, & \text{Definitions of $P$ and $Q$}
        }
        which of course proves the result.
    }
    Finally, we are ready to prove the original assertion that the symmetric difference is associative.
    \qproof{
        For any $x$, define the proposition $P$ as $x \in A$, $Q$ as $x \in B$ and $R$ as $x \in C$.
        We then have that

    (a) \qproof{
        $(\to)$ First assume that $A \ss B$.

        To show that $A \cap B = A$, first consider $x \in A \cap B$, then clearly $x \in A$ so that $A \cap B \ss A$.
        Now suppose that $x \in A$ so that also $x \in B$ since $A \ss B$.
        Hence, $x \in A$ and $x \in B$ so that $x \in A \cap B$, showing that $A \ss A \cap B$.

        Next we show that $A \cup B = B$.
        First consider any $x \in A \cup B$.
        If $x \in A$ then also $x \in B$ since $A \ss B$.
        Since, in the other case, we have that $x \in B$ directly, it follows that $A \cup B \ss B$.
        Now suppose that $x \in B$ so that clearly also $x \in A \cup B$, and so $B \ss A \cup B$ as well.

        Finally, we show that $A - B = \es$.
        To see this, assume first that $A - B \neq \es$ so that there is an $x \in A - B$.
        Thus, $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$.
        However, $x \in A$ implies that $x \in B$ since $A \ss B$, which is a contradiction.

        $(\leftarrow)$ First suppose that $A \cap B = A$ and consider any $x \in A$ so that also $x \in A \cap B$, and hence $x \in B$ as well.
        This shows that $A \ss B$.

        Next, suppose that $A \cup B = B$ and consider any $x \in A$.
        Then $x \in A \cup B = B$, which suffices to show that $x \in B$ and thus $A \ss B$.

        Lastly, suppose that $A - B = \es$ and consider any $x \in A$.
        Were it the case that $x \notin B$ then it would follow that $x \in A - B = \es$, an impossibility.
        Hence, it has to be that $x \in B$ as well so that $A \ss B$ again.

        This all suffices to show that
        \gath{
            A \ss B \bic A \cap B = A \bic A \cup B = B \bic A - B = \es
        }
        as desired.
    }

    (b) \qproof{
        $(\to)$ Suppose first that $A \ss B \cap C$ and consider any $x \in A$.
        Then also $x \in B \cap C$ so that both $x \in B$ and $x \in C$.
        As $x$ was arbitrary, this shows that both $A \ss B$ and $A \ss C$.

        $(\leftarrow)$ Now suppose that $A \ss B$ and $A \ss C$ and consider any $x \in A$.
        Then both $x \in B$ since $A \ss B$, and $x \in C$ since $A \ss C$.
        Therefore, $x \in B \cap C$, showing that $A \ss B \cap C$.
    }

    (c) \qproof{
        $(\to)$ First suppose that $B \cup C \ss A$ and consider any $x \in B$.
        Then $x \in B \cup C$ so that also $x \in A$, showing that $B \ss A$.
        Similarly, for any $x \in C$ we have that again $x \in B \cup C$ so that $x \in A$.
        This shows that $C \ss A$ as well.

        $(\leftarrow)$ Now suppose that both $B \ss A$ and $C \ss A$ and consider any $x \in B \cup C$.
        In the case in which $x \in B$, we have that $x \in A$ since $B \ss A$.
        In the other case in which $x \in C$ we also have $x \in A$ since $C \ss A$ as well.
        This shows that $B \cup C \ss A$ since $x$ was arbitrary.
    }

    (d) \qproof{
        $(\ss)$ Suppose that $x \in A - B$ so that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$.
        Then of course also $x \in A \cup B$ since $x \in A$.
        Since also $x \notin B$ it follows that $x \in (A \cup B) - B$, showing that $A - B \ss (A \cup B) - B$.
        We also have that $x \notin A \cap B$ since $x \notin B$.
        Hence, also $x \in A - (A \cap B)$ so that $A - B \ss A - (A \cap B)$ as well.

        $(\supseteq)$ Suppose that $x \in (A \cup B) - B$.
        Then $x \in A \cup B$ and $x \notin B$.
        Since it must be that $x \in A$ or $x \in B$, but $x \notin B$, it must be that $x \in A$.
        Hence, $x \in A - B$, which proves that $(A \cup B) - B \ss A - B$.

        Now suppose that $x \in A - (A \cap B)$ so that $x \in A$ and $x \notin A \cap B$.
        Since $x \in A$ it has to be that $x \notin B$ since otherwise it would be that $x \in A \cap B$.
        Therefore, $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$ so that $x \in A - B$, showing that also $A - (A \cap B) \ss A - B$.

        This all is sufficient to show that
        \gath{
            A - B = (A \cup B) - B = A - (A \cap B)
        }
