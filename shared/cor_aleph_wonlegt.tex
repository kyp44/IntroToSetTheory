\begin{cor}\label{cor:aleph:wonlegt}
  If $A$ and $B$ are well ordered sets then $\aA \nleq \aB$ if and only if $\aB < \aA$.
\end{cor}
\qproof{
  ($\to$) Suppose that $\aA \nleq \aB$.
  Then it follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:aleph:wolege} above that $\aB \leq \aA$.
  Suppose that $\aB = \aA$.
  Then there is a bijection $f$ from $B$ to $A$.
  But then clearly $\inv{f}$ is also a bijection and therefore injective.
  Hence by definition $\aA \leq \aB$, a contradiction.
  So it cannot be that $\aB = \aA$.
  Hence $\aB < \aA$ by definition as desired.

  ($\leftarrow$) We show this by proving the contrapositive.
  So suppose that $\aA \leq \aB$.
  Also suppose that $\aB \leq \aA$ so that by Lemma~\ref{lem:aleph:wolege} above $\aA = \aB$.
  Thus we have shown that
  \gath{
    \aB \leq \aA \to \aA = \aB \\
    \aB \nleq \aA \lor \aA = \aB \\
    \lnot \parens{\aB \leq \aA \land \aA \neq \aB} \\
    \lnot (\aB < \aA),
  }
  thereby showing the contrapositive.
